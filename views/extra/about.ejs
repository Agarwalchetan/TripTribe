      <h3>So... what's TripTribe?</h3>
      <p>
        TripTribe started with one goal: <strong>to make travel planning less painful</strong> than a group project in college.
        We were tired of chaotic WhatsApp groups, lost screenshots, and that one friend who never replies. So, we created a space where travelers
        can connect, plan, and explore — without losing their minds (or their socks).
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're a solo adventurer, a "let's plan a Goa trip for the 47th time" dreamer, or someone who just wants to find a tribe to vibe with —
        TripTribe is for you.

      <h3>Meet the Tribe Behind TripTribe 🧠❤️</h3>
      <p>
        We’re a group of caffeine-fueled developers, designers, and meme lords who believe that travel is better when it’s shared (and when the
        Wi-Fi works). Our team includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>🚀 Coders who write more bugs than code (but fix them eventually)</li>
        <li>🎨 Designers who argue about font sizes at 2am</li>
        <li>📢 Marketers who think hashtags solve everything</li>
        <li>🍕 A guy who only joined for the snacks</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Our Philosophy: Travel, Tribe, Repeat. ✈️👫🌄</h3>
    <p class="lead">
      We’re not just building a platform. We’re building a movement — where travelers become friends, friends become tribes, and tribes make memories
      that don’t fit in an Instagram story.
