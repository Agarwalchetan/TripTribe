    🕵️‍♂️ TripTribe's Totally Serious Privacy Policy
  </h1>

  <p>
    Welcome, fellow explorer! This is the part where we pretend to be grown-ups
    and talk about how we protect your top-secret data while you're busy
    planning adventures (or just stalking cool travel pics).
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h3>🧠 What We Know About You</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Your name (unless you entered “Batman”).</li>
    <li>Your email (so we can occasionally spam... we mean *inform* you).</li>
    <li>Your travel bucket list (we might steal some ideas 🏝️).</li>
    <li>Random clicks and scrolls you didn’t know were being watched. 👀</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🛡️ How We Protect Your Data</h3>
  <p>
    We lock your data in a virtual vault guarded by ninjas, encrypted with the
    tears of frustrated hackers, and stored on servers that definitely don’t run
    on potato batteries (anymore).
  </p>

  <h3>🍪 Cookies? Yes, Please!</h3>
  <p>
    We use cookies. Not the chocolate chip kind, unfortunately. These cookies
    help us remember your preferences and whether you prefer mountains or
    beaches... or both. 🍫🌊⛰️
  </p>

  <h3>🤝 Third-Party Shenanigans</h3>
  <p>
    Sometimes we work with other cool websites. They might peek at your data,
    but only if they promise not to do anything sketchy — pinky swear 🤞.
  </p>

  <h3>👶 Kid’s Stuff</h3>
  <p>
    If you’re under 13, please go play outside. This site isn’t for baby
    adventurers. Come back when you’re old enough to survive a group trip to
    Goa. 😅
  </p>

  <h3>📬 Changes to This Policy</h3>
  <p>
    If we ever decide to start selling your data to aliens (just kidding!),
    we’ll update this policy and let you know in bold, flashing Comic Sans.
  </p>
