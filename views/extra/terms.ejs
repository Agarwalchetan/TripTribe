    📜 TripTribe's Totally Reasonable Terms & Conditions
  </h1>

  <p>
    By using TripTribe, you agree to the following terms. Don’t worry — we won’t
    make you sign anything in blood (yet).
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h4>1. 🚀 You Use It, You’re Responsible</h4>
  <p>
    If you use TripTribe to plan a spontaneous trip to the Himalayas with
    strangers and forget to pack socks — that’s on you, champ.
  </p>

  <h4>2. 🧭 Navigation May Vary</h4>
  <p>
    We try to keep TripTribe bug-free, smooth, and magical. But sometimes, the
    internet breaks. Or a squirrel chews through the server cables. Be patient.
  </p>

  <h4>3. 🔥 No Mischief Allowed</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>No pretending to be Elon Musk.</li>
    <li>No fake reviews like “Best trip ever with aliens!”</li>
    <li>No uploading weird cat memes (unless travel-related).</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>4. 🧙‍♂️ Content Ownership</h4>
  <p>
    Stuff you post is still yours. But by uploading, you give us a license to
    show it off on TripTribe, our Instagram, and possibly a billboard in Goa
    (okay maybe not that last one).
  </p>

  <h4>5. 🧼 Don’t Be Gross</h4>
  <p>
    No offensive stuff. No hate speech. No weird photos of feet. Keep it classy,
    people.
  </p>

  <h4>6. 🧾 Changes to the Terms</h4>
  <p>
    We might update these terms at any time. When we do, we’ll let you know —
    probably with a dancing llama gif. 🦙
  </p>

  <h4>7. 🕳️ Liability Escape Hatch</h4>
  <p>
    If your road trip ends in a flat tire, a sunburn, or an awkward silent
    moment with strangers… we’re not responsible. But we still love you.
  </p>
